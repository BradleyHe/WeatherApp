# WeatherApp
Weather app that takes data from the wunderground api and implements it in a basic gui. 

Note: In order to use the program, you must create a api key at https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/. Unfortunately, wunderground recently made it so that you have to pay in order to obtain an api key. When I wrote this program, wunderground still allowed people to create free api keys. If you want to use this program and not have to pay for it, please contact me at bhe6001@gmail.com so that I can provide you with a key.
